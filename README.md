Spam news detection involves using machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and fact-checking tools to identify and filter out misleading, false, or biased news. It addresses challenges such as identifying sensational language, misinformation, and clickbait. Methods like text classification, sentiment analysis, and deep learning are employed to analyze news content for credibility. Tools and platforms like NewsGuard, Snopes, and automated detection systems help flag suspicious articles. As misinformation spreads quickly, ongoing research aims to improve detection speed, accuracy, and fairness, ensuring users access reliable information.
